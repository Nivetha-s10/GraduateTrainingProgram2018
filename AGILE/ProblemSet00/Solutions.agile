1)How does agile testing (development) methodology differ from other testing (development) methodologies?

If you need to quickly release a basic product that you can later build on and add more features to, then the agile methodology may be more appropriate for the product to be delivered.

The agile process is broken into individual models that designers work on whereas in other models it is not generally broken down into models.
The customer has early and frequent opportunities to look at the product and make decision and changes to the project which fosters trust and satisafaction to the customer.
It also requires close communication with developers and together analyze requirements and planning.

2)What are the most important components of Agile?

Individual and team interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

3)What is difference between Epic,features, User stories & Tasks?

Epic: A very large user story that is eventually broken down into smaller stories.
User story: A very high-level definition of a requirement, containing just enough information so that the developers 
can implement it.In simple it is a Business Functionality.
Feature: The characteristics  of a software application  ( for e.g., performance, portability, or functionality)


4)Explain what is a product backlog in Scrum

7)What do you understand by sprint backlog?

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, and plans for delivering the product Increment. 

8)What is the role of the Product Owner?
Product Owner is responsible for the prioritized work item list , for making decisions, and for providing information in a timely manner.
